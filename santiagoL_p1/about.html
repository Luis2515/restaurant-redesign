          best produce the british isles has to offer, showcased in dishes
          inspired by isaac’s culinary memories and travels.
          <br />
          <br />
          To accompany our tasting menus, we offer an extensive wine list that
          showcases some of the most exciting contemporary winemakers alongside
          a selection of fine, classical old world wines.
          <br />
          <br />
